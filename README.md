# iw6_function_ids
iw6 gsc dump with labeled function ids

i take no credit for dumping these files, rather i decompiled them using [xensik's gsc tool](https://github.com/xensik/gsc-tool)

also checkout [mjkzy's iw6 gsc dump](https://github.com/mjkzy/iw6-gsc-dump) to see what functions go with what id numbers

**NOTE** this is not 100% complete as some files may be missing and some ids not visible
